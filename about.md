My research focuses on applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze astronomical datasets. I have a particular interest in studying variable stars, such as RR Lyrae stars, and their behavior. By developing innovative algorithms and models, I aim to extract valuable information from these celestial objects, enabling a deeper understanding of their intrinsic properties and evolution.

Throughout my academic journey, I have collaborated with esteemed astronomers and researchers, and I have actively contributed to the field through scientific publications and conference presentations. I have also been involved in organizing workshops and seminars, aiming to disseminate knowledge and foster collaboration among fellow researchers.
